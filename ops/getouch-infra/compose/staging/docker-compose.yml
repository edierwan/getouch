# DEPRECATED — Staging shares the main Caddy + Cloudflare tunnel.
# Dev routes (dev.getouch.co) are in the main Caddyfile.
# Only staging/docker-compose.apps.yml and docker-compose.db-staging.yml are needed.
#
# To bring up staging apps:
#   cd /opt/getouch/compose/staging
#   docker compose -p getouch-stg -f docker-compose.apps.yml up -d --build
